# Project Proposal: Mos3ef

## 1.1 Project Proposal

Mos3ef is a comprehensive digital healthcare platform developed using .NET Web API.

1.  **Accessibility:** Provide patients with instant access to hospital service details and working hours.
2.  **Transparency:** Enable price and rating comparisons between different healthcare providers.
3.  **Efficiency:** Allow hospitals to digitally manage their profiles and services.
4.  **Quality Assurance:** Implement a review system to maintain high service standards.
